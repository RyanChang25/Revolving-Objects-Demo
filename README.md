# Revolving Objects Demo!

### Overview

A small game I worked on in the past. Decided to open source it in case anyone is curious on how it works.

Used `Sine and Cosine` functions in conjunction with `Prototype-Based Classes (OOP)` to make a table of revolving objects with sine waves to create a bobbing effect. You can add/delete objects from the table, adjust the radius, angular velocity, and amplitude calculations in-game if you're interested in how it works!
